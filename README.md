# airports-django
This assignemnt is part of a pair of assignments we have been tasked to do in a class, where we perform CRUD operations on a database of Airport objects, and the GUI displays the content of the database. This assignment must connect to a server using REST operations. The other assignement uses SQL to connect to a Derby database. The app was written in Java and the GUI uses Swing.
The server the teacher provided during the class is not available, so I wrote a server in Django framework to do the server-side connection to the database. The database is implemented in SQLite. The server can be found in the repository called airports-django. To be able to run the server here, one must have Python and the Django module installed. To start the server, run the line "python manage.py runserver" ("py manage.py runserver in Windows") in the command line, in the folder where manage.py is installed. Once the server is started, the compiled Java app can be run, and will automatically connect to the Django server (the app will connect to localhost:8000).
Once the software is set up, airports data can be entered in the graphical interface and added to the database using "Add New." Airports can be modified using "Update" or deleted using "Delete." When an airport is selected, the app will find the nearest airport using "Find Nearest Airport" and display the distance. The algorithm for calculating distances was obtained from GeoDataSource.
